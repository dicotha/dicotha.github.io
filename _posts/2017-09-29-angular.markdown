This is my first post here in my blog and I like to star with Angular.  


Angular is a most powerful frontend framework.  
And I would to explain fast your history.  
Angular first calling Angularjs was created inside of google in 2009.  
Is a framework open source with a huge community behind.  
With this, angular had a lot of upgrades, starting with angular 2 and then the angular 4.  
But where is the angular 3 ?  
I have a explanation about this, the development of angular is it in five parts  
	1- core  
	2- compiler  
	3- compiler-cli  
	4- http  
	5- router  
In the four first parts the version it was 2.3.0, and the router part was in 3.0.0, so the google decided to stop label the angular versions and call the framework only Angular.  
Is more or less this, but to summing up is this, Angular now is only call Angular.  

<h2>So, let's start your first project:</h2>

To start, you need have to install the node.js in your machine  


Open this link and download the last version of the node.js  

<nav class="cl-effect-3">
	<a class="link" href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Nodejs</a>
</nav>  

After you install de node, we go to terminal and type this command  

{% highlight ruby %}
node -v 
{% endhighlight %}

If all was install correct, you will see de version of de Nodejs  

Another line of command is 

{% highlight ruby %}
npm -v 
{% endhighlight %}

The same thing, will show for you the version of the npm

The next step is install the Angular CLI  
Yet in terminal, put this command.

{% highlight ruby %}
npm install -g @angular/cli
{% endhighlight %}

This will download all dependencies of Angular Cli and put him in global mode.

After do all this, we can start a development in angular.  

Two things we will use a lot.  

Visual Studio Code (Or another if you prefer, example Sublime).  
Link to download the  <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio</a>  
And the terminal.  


Comeback to your terminal, find the folder where you can create your project and type the command line below  

{% highlight ruby %}
ng new my-first-app
{% endhighlight %}

This will download all files that we need to start, when the download finish you will see this informations
