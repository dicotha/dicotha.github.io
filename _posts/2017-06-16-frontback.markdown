First at all, I need explain how the posts will show for you.

In the title you will see the name of the language that i will use, after that the name of the tutorial and on the finished you will see which part he is.

Inside the post I will show the code with this highlights ⬇️

{% highlight ruby %}
<? echo hellow world ?>
{% endhighlight %}
